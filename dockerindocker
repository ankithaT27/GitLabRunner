When we run a pipeline using a docker agent, we are using ruby image by default, but we need a docker image available to run docker build commands. This is where DID comes in.
So we install a docker container for docker daemon, ine for client and a certificate so that they can communicate with each other

docker_build:
  image: docker:20.10.16
  service:
    - docker:20.10.16-dnd
  variables:
      DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs"
